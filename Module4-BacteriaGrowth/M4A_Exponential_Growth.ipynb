    "There are seemingly countless numerical integrators available to you in nearly all computer programming languages. The simplest and easiest to code (although it has some limitations) is the Forward-Euler method. In this approach, we take very small steps forward in time, calculate the change in our quantity of interest, and then add that change to our result from the previous time step. \n",

    "\n",
    "At each time step, we are simply adding the number of cells added in that interval $\\Delta t$ as was defined in our initial differential equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we choose our time step? For this approach to work, we must take steps forward in time that are sufficiently small such that no more than one event described in our model can take place. In the context of exponential growth, for example, we would not want to take steps forward in time that are larger than the growth rate where multiple divisions could occur. This requirement, known as the [Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courant%E2%80%93Friedrichs%E2%80%93Lewy_condition) is important for many types of time-marching computer simulations."

Ultimately, all of the restrictions determine the \"carrying capacity\" of the population of interesting. This concept is nearly 200 years old, attributed to [François Verlhust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Fran%C3%A7ois_Verhulst) in 1838.

In your research, you will want to use integration packages in the programming language of your choice (such as [`scipy.integrate.odeint`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.odeint.html) for Python or [`ode45`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ode45.html) in MATLAB). These methods, though more complicated, are far faster and more robust to pathological functions that the Forward-Euler method."
